            <h2>My Unexpected Journey into Coding</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Believe it or not, I have never planned on becoming a programmer.  
                As a child, I dreamed of being a <strong>dentist</strong> ü¶∑, but life had other plans for me.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                When I started university, I was introduced to <strong>coding</strong> for the very first time.  
                It was both <strong>challenging</strong> and <strong> exciting</strong> but most of all, it was <strong> rewarding</strong>.  
                I worked hard to catch up, and before I knew it, I <strong>fell in love</strong> with programming! üíª
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Today, I enjoy problem-solving, designing user-friendly interfaces,  
                and exploring the endless possibilities that software engineering offers.  
                Looking back, I wouldn‚Äôt trade this journey for anything!

            <h2>My Family & Background</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I come from a <strong>loving and supportive family</strong> that has always encouraged me to chase my dreams.  
                Their belief in me has played a huge role in who I am today.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Outside of my studies, I love spending time with my family, making memories,  
                and learning new things from them. Family means the world to me! ‚ù§Ô∏è
